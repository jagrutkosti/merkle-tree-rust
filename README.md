## Merkle Tree implementation in Rust

For any given vector/array of arbitrary type, generates a simple merkle tree.
The hash function is customizable. It needs to be adjusted as per the required method signature though.

An example is availabe in `main.rs`.

For testing the example, simply run `cargo run` from the root dir.
